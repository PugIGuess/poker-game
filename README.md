# poker-game
currently a simple, singleplayer, roguelike (sorta) poker game.
you can upgrade the table card size, amount of rerolls, and soon to be multipliers.
the game will expand further than it's at now, which is just stage 1.
I also plan to move this to javascript probably after I get this stage done.
